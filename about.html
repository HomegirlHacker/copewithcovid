          <h2>Amehja Williams</h2>
          <p>
            Amehja is an 11th grader, living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She
            attends Pennsylvania Leadership Charter School and is an avid
            explorer of STEAM. She enjoys playing the piano, creative writing,
            and listening to music in her free time. COVID-19 has had a personal
            effect on her family because Amehja's aunt is a nurse working on the
            front lines, which is a very daunting and stressful job.

          <p>
            Ashi is an 8th grader of Folsom Middle School. She lives in Folsom,
            California. She loves to go out for bike rides on the trails, or
            just take a quick stroll to get a quick breath of fresh air. She
            mostly loves playing sports and doing other outdoor activities.
            Aside from that, she enjoys coding and playing with her little
            sister. Due to the coronavirus, all her outdoor activities have been
            banned and she is stuck in her house all day, like other people
            around the globe.

          <p>
            Bhavya is an 8th grader, living in Cupertino, California. She

            time are drawing, reading, and watching TV. She also enjoys spending
            time outside in parks. Covid -19 has closed down all schools, so she
            has to use distance learning, which can be a challenge for some
            people.
