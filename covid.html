          Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and
          some cause disease. A newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has
          caused a worldwide pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.
        </h2>
        <h1>How does the new coronavirus spread?</h1>
        <p>
          As of now, researchers know that the new coronavirus is spread through
          droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or
          sneezes. The droplets generally do not travel more than a few feet,
          and they fall to the ground (or onto surfaces) in a few seconds — this
          is why physical distancing is effective in preventing the spread.
        </p>
        <h1>How did this new coronavirus spread to humans?</h1>
        <p>
          COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, a city in China, in December 2019.
          Although health officials are still tracing the exact source of this
          new coronavirus, early hypotheses thought it may be linked to a
          seafood market in Wuhan, China. Some people who visited the market
          developed viral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus. A study that
          came out on Jan. 25, 2020, notes that the individual with the first
          reported case became ill on Dec. 1, 2019, and had no link to the
          seafood market. Investigations are ongoing as to how this virus
          originated and spread.
        </p>
        <h1>What is the incubation period for COVID-19?</h1>
        <p>
          It appears that symptoms are showing up in people within 14 days of
          exposure to the virus.
        </p>
        <h1>What are symptoms of COVID-19?</h1>
        <p>COVID-19 symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cough</li>
          <li>Fever or chills</li>
          <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
          <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
          <li>Sore throat</li>
          <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
          <li>Diarrhea</li>
          <li>Headache</li>
          <li>Fatigue</li>
          <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
          <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In rare cases, COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory problems,
          kidney failure or death. If you have a fever or any kind of
          respiratory difficulty such as coughing or shortness of breath, call
          your doctor or a health care provider and explain your symptoms over
          the phone before going to the doctor’s office, urgent care facility or
          emergency room.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a medical emergency such as severe shortness of breath,
          call 911 and let them know about your symptoms.
