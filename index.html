            According to the World Health Organization (WHO), coronaviruses are
            a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common
            cold to more severe diseases. Now this family of viruses includes
            the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV); a new strain that has not been
            previously identified in humans.

            We met online through a Hackathon hosted by Helix Hacks. During the
            time that this website was made, the world was in a pandemic. A
            novel coronavirus named COVID-19 had broke out from a lab in Wuhan,
            China causing the virus to spread world wide. Currently there are
            19.4M+ cases worldwide, from which 11.8M+ recovered, and 722K+ died.

            Having distance learning in high school might be really tough.
            That's why during the free time you have, you should learn to
            "sharpen the saw" once in a while. Take a break both mentally and
            physically.
